This project is a simple React-based web application that demonstrates how to create a product detail page using React components and JSX with Babel. The page displays detailed information about a product (a watch), including an image, description, features, and specifications.

## Overview

The application showcases the use of React to build a static product page. The app is structured into separate components for better modularity and reuse. Each component represents a different section of the product page.

## Components

### Watch Component

The **Watch** component displays the main product details, including:

- A product image.
- The product name ("Automatic Watch").
- The price of the product.
- A brief description of the product.

### Features Component

The **Features** component lists the key features of the watch. It is split into two columns to display:

- Left Column: Chronograph, Master Chronometer Certified, Tachymeter.
- Right Column: Anti-magnetic, Chronometer, Small seconds.

### ProductDetails Component

The **ProductDetails** component provides detailed specifications of the watch, such as:

- Between lugs: 20 mm.
- Bracelet: Leather strap.
- Case: Steel.
- Case Diameter: 42 mm.
- Dial Color: Black.
- Crystal: Domed, scratch-resistant sapphire crystal with anti-reflective treatment inside.
- Water resistance: 5 bar (50 meters / 167 feet).

### App Component

The **App** component is the main component that combines all other components to render the complete product page. It also includes:

- An "ADD TO CART" button.
- A delivery message indicating a 2-3 business days delivery time.

## How to Run

To run this application:

1. Make sure you have a browser that supports ES6 JavaScript.
2. Copy the entire HTML code into an `.html` file.
3. Open the file in your web browser.
4. The application will load and display the product detail page.

This application uses React and ReactDOM via CDN links, and Babel to compile JSX into JavaScript that the browser can understand.
